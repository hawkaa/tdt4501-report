\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:Thesis Outline}
We structure our thesis as following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chapter 2} introduces background material relevant to this thesis. Here, we study \bi, \bd, \genusSoftware, and testing.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 3-6} go into details techniques that are paramount to OLAP and \bd~performance, namely \textit{data layout}, \textit{data compression}, \textit{indexes and auxiliary structures}, and \textit{parallelization}.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 7} studies techniques relevant for query processing in \bd~applications in terms of \textit{joining}, \textit{grouping and aggregation}, and \textit{query optimization}.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 8} shows that careful implementation is required for a system to perform well.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 9} elaborates on other considerations in a \bd~application, like \textit{application design}, \textit{denormalization}, \textit{disk support}, and \textit{write support}.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 10} concludes this thesis and points at interesting directions for future work.
\end{itemize}
