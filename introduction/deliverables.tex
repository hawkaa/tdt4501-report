\section{Deliverables}
\label{sec:Deliverables}
\begin{secex}
This part will explain the two main deliverables: A thorough litterature review, and some indication on which techniques are the most fruitful for \genusSoftware.
\end{secex}
The first two parts of the thesis will be a literature review and a similar product analysis. These two chapters let me familiarize myself to the most recent research within the field, and have a look at how competing products solves the problems. The ultimate goal for these chapters is to be able to come up with a discussion and analysis of the hypotheses stated in section \ref{sec:problem-statement-and-goals}, which will be the third pard of the thesis. This part will also include a section of other issues that has not been thought of so far.

The last part of the thesis, based on the results so far, will contain a design proposal for a Busines Intelligence implementation in \genusSoftware.
