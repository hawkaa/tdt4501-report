\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:Contributions}
The novelty of this thesis is two-fold. Most related work presesnts a single system and explains the techniques use there. Here, I present the litterature by category, not by product. This way, comparisons can be made more easily, and it is easier to get an overview over where the litterature agrees, and where there are contradictions. I have not found related work that directly compares implementations, only presentations of single systems or concepts.

The second contribution, is a thorough discussion on where the various techniques presented applies. \genusSoftware have several fundamental and practical limitations, and based on these, I present the techniques that are the most fruitful. Optimizations in columnar storage have already been investigated by Abadi \ea~\cite{Abadi2008-dd}, however this work focus on the fundamental differences between row and column stores. I present a more holistic picture, considering more concepts and techniques. In addition to this, this thesis specifically targets \genusSoftware.
