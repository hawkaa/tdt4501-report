\section{Problem statement and goals}
\label{sec:problem-statement-and-goals}
This thesis will try to answer the following research question:

\textbf{Which challenges does \genus~face when implementing a module for Business Intelligence in their \genusSoftware?}

We will address the issue by scrutinizing the following hypothesis:

\textbf{\genus~has identified the following key issues:}
\begin{enumerate}\bfseries
  \item Indexes have to be created dynamically, and there is a question of which and when.
  \item The multitenancy support in \genusSoftware will affect the index generation
  \item Formulas must be calculated efficiently to not become a bottleneck
  \item Indexes and data must be compressed in order to get performance.
  \item Selections have to be reasonably compressed in order to minimize the amount of data sent through the network.
\end{enumerate}
