\section{In-Memory Database Systems}
\label{sec:imds}
According to \cite{Zicari2012-is}, an in-memory database system is a system that uses memory (RAM) as its primary storage, and requires no disk or I/O operations. In-Memory database systems can be used where performance and low latency is a key design goal, and on systems that simply has no need for persistant storage.

In-memory databases strive to use the storage efficiently, since memory is not abundant as ordinary hard drives.
