\label{chap:background}
\begin{secex}
This chapter will introduce relevant background information.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Analytical vs Tranasctional workloads. How they normally was a separate system, but wants to unite. Use the Pavlic thesis on this. Star and snowflake schema?
  \item Background on column stores.
  \item Background on in-memory storages.
  \item Background on compression.
  \item Background on business intelligence and how it evolved into business discovery. Should explain the nature of the queries, and that they cannot be anticipated. Perhaps something about non-SQL type of queries.
  \item Predicate evaluation
  \item Background on testing (TPC-H, Snowflake, TPC-CH ++)
  \item Background on which vendors are out there. Explain the TPC-H benchmark, and which vendors are on top.
  \item Bacground on cardinality of columns
  \item Selectivity
\end{enumerate}
