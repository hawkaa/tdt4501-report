\section{Microsoft, IBM, SAP, and Oracle}
Microsoft, SAP, IBM, and Oracle does all supply OLAP solutions. There has been several blog posts and articles (\textit{insert references here}) on which of these products are the best. Lots of these blog posts are very biased, and there is little doubt they're written from a marketers perspective. However, there's been little doubt that they all offer high performance analytics solutions. What is common for all of them is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Columnar storage
  \item In-memory storage
  \item Indexing
\end{itemize}

They all seem to agree on the above points.

However, some people claim that these solutions are not pure In-Memory Database Systems (IMDS) (cite Steve Graves). They are only 100\%~cached databases tweaked to exploit the available memory.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}
Since \genusSoftware supports several different database backends, and among them providers like MySQL which does not support in-memory database tables, one can not utilize the DBMS technology which exists. \genus must develop their own system, preferably a pure IMDS.
